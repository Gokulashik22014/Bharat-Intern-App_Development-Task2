This is a simple weather forecast app that was created using react native in the that use Weatherapi to fetch the data of the weather so thanks to Weatherapi for my 14 days free trial


Set up instruction:
    step 1:You need Weatherapi key in order to get it so login and get you free trial
        link->https://www.weatherapi.com/
    step 2:Once you got your api key navigate to Screens->Data.js
    step 3:Here in the api paste your api
    step 4:now type "npm install" to install all the packages
    step 5: your good to use the app

Image:
    The images are crafted for small size as a result when they are enlarged they break into pixels so they need fixing that is if you find them as a eye sore 

Since I am a beginner to react native I need to learn and improve a lot so if you find any issues in running the app or any suggestions to improve it please let me know 

Thank you Have a great Day!
